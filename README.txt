Mythos LACKEYCCG PLUGIN README v1.10
15/07/2023

Latest Update: 
Version 1.10 Notes
* Images upscaled to improve clarity in online gaming. Note that the Movieland expansion was not upscaled due to image quality issues.
* Automatic updates and downloading have been incoporated and the files moved from the original google drive location. Enabling automatic updates within Lackey and adding the file locations should make the installation and updates full proof and consistent.
* All files, configuration, images and data have been moved to a new location.

Planned Additions
-----------------------------------------------------------
Starter Box and Booster Pack implementation. This is more for fun as Mythos does not really support a draft or sealed mode.


Steadfast Contributions
-----------------------------------------------------------
* This plugin is built from the work I did for CCGWorkshop in 2004 nonetheless this plugin would not be here because of, or incorporates work from, the following people:
** Alex Broadhard, Mythos Rules Guru, creator of numerous documents incorporating all the work on reporting the original adventure cards for balance.
** Martin Charlebois: creator of the Movieland expansion based on the movie Rosemary’s Baby, Mythos Guru and owner of the Mythos Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/324907134342777 
** The Scocby Doo expansion was created by Corey Whitworth with assistance from Philip Robinson
** Koen Buytaert who scanned, cropped and reseized all the Limited, Miskatonic University, Cthulhu Rising and Legends of the Nerconomicon cards and kindly shared them.
** Jason Franks for all the help, support, information and putting up with constant questions, with sharing the files and implementing automatic updates for the plugin.


Auto-Updating
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Mythos plugin is an now an auto-updating plugin, that contains both the original Mythos card set as well as the Movieland, Scooby Doo and Repointed card sets. 
* Within Lackey go to the Plugin Tab, and select/tick the "Automatically check for plugin updates" under the listed plugin.

Downloading the images
-----------------------------------------------------------
Lackey likes to download images on an as-needed basis, but you can force it to download all images up front. The way to do this is to go to Preferences/Miscellaneous and check the box labeled "Allow pre-downloading images for offline use". After this a button is enabled in the Plugin menu labeled "Download all missing card images".
In some instances when card images change a 'v2' card image will be uploaded, and the set file will link to that card image. This means the old card image will persist in the folder, even though it will no longer be referenced by the plugin. There is no way for the plugin update process to delete the old image If we provide the new image with the same filename as the old image, it will not be downloaded (because images are not checksummed). The only sure fire way to get rid of the old images is to delete the plugin and reinstall.
